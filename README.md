# Solar Cells and Sun Tracking System

## Introduction

Solar cells harness light photons to generate electricity by creating electron-hole pairs at the p-n junction. This README explores the working principles of solar cells, the importance of solar radiation, and the concept of sun tracking.

## Solar Cells

Solar cells consist of layers of semiconductor materials that convert light energy into electrical energy. Silicon, with its optimal band gap, is the most commonly used material due to its efficiency in energy conversion.

## Solar Radiation

Solar radiation includes UV, visible, and infrared light, crucial for energy capture in solar cells. The distribution and types of solar radiation impact energy generation and human exposure.

## Sun Tracking Systems

### Single Axis Trackers

Single-axis trackers follow the Sun's path from east to west, optimizing solar panel efficiency. They are cost-effective but have limitations in higher latitudes.

- [Vertical Single-Axis Solar Tracker (VSAT)](https://www.solarfeeds.com/mag/solar-trackers-types-and-its-advantages-and-disadvantages/)

### Dual Axis Trackers

Dual-axis trackers adjust both vertically and horizontally, maximizing solar energy absorption throughout the day. They are more complex and expensive but offer higher efficiency.

## Working of LDRs

Light-dependent resistors (LDRs) detect light intensity by varying their resistance based on incident light. They are crucial in automated solar tracking systems.
